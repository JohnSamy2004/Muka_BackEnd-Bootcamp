# JavaScript Variable Types, Type Coercion, and Operators

This project contains several JavaScript examples that demonstrate the use of variable declarations (`let`, `const`, `var`), type coercion, operators, and logical comparisons.

## Files:
- `variables.js`: Demonstrates the differences between `let`, `const`, and `var`.
- `typeCoercion.js`: Experiments with type coercion by combining different data types in operations.
- `operators.js`: Contains examples of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
- `evenOdd.js`: Checks if a number is even or odd using comparison operators.
- `stringComparison.js`: Compares two strings using logical operators.

## Table of Operators:

### Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description            | Example      | Result |
|----------|------------------------|--------------|--------|
| +        | Addition                | 5 + 3        | 8      |
| -        | Subtraction             | 5 - 3        | 2      |
| *        | Multiplication          | 5 * 3        | 15     |
| /        | Division                | 5 / 3        | 1.666  |
| %        | Modulus (Remainder)     | 5 % 3        | 2      |
| **       | Exponentiation          | 5 ** 3       | 125    |

### Comparison Operators
| Operator | Description                  | Example        | Result |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| >        | Greater than                 | 5 > 3          | true   |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to     | 5 >= 5         | true   |
| <        | Less than                    | 5 < 3          | false  |
| <=       | Less than or equal to        | 5 <= 3         | false  |
| ==       | Equality (with coercion)     | 5 == '5'       | true   |
| ===      | Strict equality (no coercion)| 5 === '5'      | false  |
| !=       | Inequality (with coercion)   | 5 != '5'       | false  |
| !==      | Strict inequality (no coercion)| 5 !== '5'    | true   |

### Logical Operators
| Operator | Description   | Example            | Result |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|--------|
| &&       | AND           | true && false      | false  |
| \|\|     | OR            | true \|\| false    | true   |
| !        | NOT           | !true              | false  |

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run each JavaScript file in a Node.js environment or in the browser console.
